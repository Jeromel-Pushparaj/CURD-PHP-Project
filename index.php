        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><code>CREATE DATABASE dbname;</code> - Creates a new database.</li>
            <li><code>CREATE TABLE tablename (columns);</code> - Creates a new table.</li>
            <li><code>INSERT INTO tablename (columns) VALUES (values);</code> - Inserts new data into a table.</li>
            <li><code>SELECT * FROM tablename;</code> - Retrieves data from a table.</li>
            <li><code>UPDATE tablename SET column=value WHERE condition;</code> - Updates existing data in a table.</li>
            <li><code>DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition;</code> - Deletes data from a table.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Choose MySQL?</h2>
        
        <p>
            MySQL is a great choice for a variety of reasons.
